    You decide to obey other peoples property so you continue down the street.
    There are many cars at this hour and the streets are busy.

    You turn on your siren and rush down the street.

    Unfortunately for you there was an accident and it's blocked the entire street.

    You begin hating yourself for not taking the shortcut, after all you are a cop.
    Doesn't going to a crime scene give you an excuse to trespass?

    As you are about to begin turning back, you hear a loud scream,
    it sounded like a woman, and she sounded desperate.

    What do you do? <a class="continue" href="../5/index.html">Stay in your car</a> or <a class="continue" href="../6/index.html">Get out and investigate</a>?
