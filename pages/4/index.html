    You decide to save some precious time and take the shortcut.
    
    As you begin driving down the alley your headlight catches a gruesome scene.

    In front of you lies a bloodied body, the victim, dead. 
    You've just discovered a crime scene.

    As you are about to get off and investigate you remember about the robbery.

    Do you ignore the scene infront of you and call for nearby units?
    Or do you investigate?
    The evidence is fresh and the killer may still be nearby.

    What will you do?
  <a class="continue" href="">Ignore</a> or <a class="continue" href="">Investigate</a>?
