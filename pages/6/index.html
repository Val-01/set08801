    You and your partner get out of the vehicle and follow the scream.
    Turns out it came from the same alley you thought about taking earlier

    As you you turn around to investigate your eye catches a gruesome scene.

    In front of you lies a bloodied body, the victim, dead. 
    You've just discovered a crime scene.

    There is no evidence of anyone nearby, and the way you came in was the only escape.
    
    You and your partner decide it's best to call for backup.
