    You decide to ignore the woman's cries for help. 
    Your partner however is not happy about it.
    
    He gets out of the vehicle and runs towards the alley, 
    the shortcut you thought about earlier.

    You run behind him, but he's faster than you.

    "AHHHHHHHH!"

    Before you can manage to catch up, you hear your partner scream.

    You turn around the corner, only to witness the most gruesome scene of your career, 
    probably even your life.

    Infront of you lie two lifeless bodies, your partner's being one of them.
