    As you and your partner begin to drive you begin to think to yourself, 
    all these years of experience have granted you knowledge of every shortcut, street 
    and corner of this city.

    If you wanted, you could take a shortcut through an alley, 
    and while it's not illegal to drive through alleys,
    this specific one requires permission.
    
    Alternatively, you may continue down the busy streets like everyone else.

    The choice is up to you? <a class="continue" href="../3/index.html">Street</a> or <a class="continue" href="../4/index.html">Shortcut</a>?
